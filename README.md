# Shell Sort and Bubble Sort Implementation

This repository contains the implementation of a project focused on sorting numbers from a file. The primary goal of this project is to sort the numbers using the Shell Sort algorithm and output the sorted data.

## Main Features

- **Shell Sort Implementation:** The main task of this project was to implement the Shell Sort algorithm. This algorithm was used to efficiently sort the numbers from the file.

- **Bubble Sort Algorithm:** As an additional implementation, the Bubble Sort algorithm was integrated. This provides a comparative perspective to Shell Sort and allows for the assessment of the efficiency of both algorithms.

- **Time Measurement:** To evaluate the performance of the algorithms, a time measurement in milliseconds was implemented. This feature enables the quantitative capture and comparison of the execution speed of the algorithms.

## Usage

To use the program, ensure that you have a text file with numbers that need to be sorted. Replace the contents of the digits.txt file with your content to apply sorting to your own sequence of numbers.
The numbers should be stored in the format Number1;Number2;Number3;...;.

The main class of the program reads the numbers from the file, performs Shell Sort or Bubble Sort after menu selection, and outputs the sorted lists. Additionally, the execution time for each run is displayed in milliseconds.

## Contribution

Feedback and contributions to this project are welcome. If you have any suggestions for improvement or ideas for optimizing the algorithms, please feel free to create a pull request or open an issue.
